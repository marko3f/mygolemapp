Package: myGolemApp
Title: A Golem app
Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person('Tom', 'Riddle', email = 'you-know-who@sbgenomics.com', role = c('cre', 'aut'))
Description: A simple Shiny app built to demonstrate the usage of the Golem framework. 
                     It allows you to explore the data related to the Harry Potter movies.
                     The original data comes from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset).
                     Due to greater portability, the data is built into this package and does not need to be loaded manually.
                     The application itself is very simple, made with the aim of demonstrating the use of some of the basic
                     functionalities and benefits of the Golem framework.
