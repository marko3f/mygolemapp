This is a simple Shiny app built to demonstrate the usage of the [Golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem) framework. It allows you to explore the data related to the Harry Potter movies. The [original data](https://www.kaggle.com/gulsahdemiryurek/harry-potter-dataset) comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Due to greater portability, the data is built into the **myGolemApp** package and does not need to be loaded manually. The application is obviously very simple, made with the aim of demonstrating the use of some of the basic functionalities and benefits of the Golem framework. Therefore, pay attention to the structure of the application itself, the way the code is organized, not so much to the content of the application.
